# Simple TODO application

This is a very simple React application that uses the local storage to keep track of added tasks. 
A missing feature is to have a timer to check for "Done" tasks to be automatically moved after X amount of time, and completely remove the cards in "Deleted" column after X time as well.

Cards can be dragged around with the mouse for a more "interactive" feeling
