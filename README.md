# Simple TODO application

This is a very simple React application that uses the local storage to keep track of added tasks. 
A missing feature is to have a timer to check for "Done" tasks to be automatically moved after X amount of time, and completely remove the cards in "Deleted" column after X time as well.

Cards can be dragged around with the mouse for a more "interactive" feeling.
The card title and description can be updated by clicking on them, after you're done with the edit you can either press the Enter key or click away from the element to save your changes.
